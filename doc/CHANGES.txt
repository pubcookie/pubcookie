Changes with 3.3.5:

*) Upgraded ISAPI filter's supporting OpenSSL libraries to version 0.9.8o.

*) Upgraded PubcookieFilter solution to Visual Studio 2008.

*) Fixed issue in the ISAPI filter related to checking signatures on
   session cookies ("Can't unbundle Session cookie"), related to 
   OpenSSL EVP_DecryptFinal and multi-threading on multi-proc systems.

Changes with 3.3.4a:

*) Applied patch to login cgi to make print_header consistent with
   print_html to fix segfaults RHEL5 (64-bit). (Patch resubmited by 
   Daniel Baber.)

Changes with 3.3.4:

*) Security fix to ISAPI filter for stack buffer overflow. (Reported by
   Chris Ries, Carnegie Mellon University.)

*) Fixed bug in the login cgi's supporting cgic library that caused
   granting request parsing problems (for referring URLs with no
   "name=value" args), which particularly affect session reauth.
   (Bug diagnosed and reported by Todd Ross.)

*) Fixed bug in login cgi allocation of space to altconfig; we were
   off by 1. (Discovered and fixed by Bradley Schwoerer and Jon Miner.)

*) Fixed bug in Apache module handling of angle brackets in the argument
   names in POST data. (Bug reported by Trevor Bortins and Jon Hauser.)

*) Fixed ISAPI filter meta-refresh redirect that enforces https to
   re-encode query string arguments prior to redirect so that values
   aren't truncated. (Bug reported by William Jordan.)

*) Fixed bug in keyserver that crashed it when using the login_servers 
   config file option. (Bug report and patch provided by Pascal Lalonde.)

*) Added support for 4096 bit private keys to login cgi.

*) Modified login cgi to log user's IP address on Redirect log line.

Changes with 3.3.3:

*) Fixed Apache module not to handle /favicon.ico requests when
   Pubcookie authentication isn't enabled. (A problem originally
   reported by Matt Petro, University of Wisconsin - Madison.)

*) Modified Apache module: on internal redirects, forward our headers
   to the new request record; with POST login method, to preserve and
   restore query string as well as post data; and added some type casts
   to avoid compiler warnings.

*) Modified ISAPI filter to log expired granting cookies as errors.

Changes with 3.3.2d:

*) Fixed login cgi handling of post data names and values during
   redirect back to the application server in the GET login method.

*) Fixed bug in Apache module's verify_url function causing some
   chars such as colons to be converted to other chars during login.

Changes with 3.3.2c:

*) Rebuilt PubcookieFilter DLL using OpenSSL 0.9.7f libraries to fix
   crypto issues with multi-threading on multi-CPU IIS servers.

*) Fixed bug in use of output filters introduced in version 3.3.2,
   in Apache 2.0.49 and higher, whereby headers set in the 'filter'
   mode are dropped when the module creates response content, logouts,
   errors, etc.

*) Fixed strlcpy.c bug. Pubcookie's implementation of strlcpy.c had
   a null termination bug when the source string (length - 1) exactly
   fits the destination string buffer.

*) Fixed Javascript call in login cgi when posting data back to the
   application server. Added '()' to document.query.submit.

Changes with 3.3.2b:

*) Modified Apache module to handle '+' chars in base-64-encoded path.

*) Modified ISAPI filter to match Apache module's handling of chars
   in the path and query strings: base64 encode and url-encode '+' 
   characters. This fixes possible truncations of uri's sent through
   the login process.

*) Modified ISAPI filter to verify that the login server sends a   
   non-empty userid in the granting reply unless No_Prompt is on.

Changes with 3.3.2a:

*) Modified Apache module to verify that the login server sends a
   non-empty userid in the granting reply unless PubcookieNoPrompt
   is on. 

*) Modifed Apache module to url-encode '+' chars after base64-encoding
   query strings. This fixes possible truncations of uri's sent through
   the login process.

*) Fixed out of place "char *datestr" declaration in Apache module. 

Changes with 3.3.2:

*) No source code changes since 3.3.2-beta2. Minor doc updates.

Changes with 3.3.2 Beta 2:

*) Fixed Apache module to check for a valid request record in 
   do_output_filter function.

*) Fixed bug in login cgi to avoid a possible loop condition with
   unexpired PBC_CLEAR_COOKIE cookies.

Changes with 3.3.2 Beta 1:

*) Modified Apache module for Apache 2.0.49 and above to set output
   headers in an output filter. This provides better compatibility with
   Apache 2.2 and other modules, and in particular with mod_proxy_ajp.

*) Added LDAPS support to LDAP verifier. Enable it with new ldap_tls
   config file variable. Configure TLS authentication with new
   ldap_key_file, ldap_cert_file, and ldap_ca_file variables.

*) Added PubcookieNoCleanCreds directive to Apache module. Allows an
   application to handle flavor_getcred credential cleanup.

*) Removed obsolete herror from Unix keyclient.c. Should fix build
   problems reported for Solaris.

Changes with 3.3.1:

*) Fixed session reauthentication messaging so that the module and
   filter can verify that the login cgi handled a reauth request.

*) Modified Apache module to base64 encode the path when using the POST
   login method. This allows ampersands and other odd chars in the path.

*) Fixed login cgi not to use the login_reauth message if the user
   hasn't authenticated to any apps yet. (Submitted by Bradley
   Schwoerer, University of Wisconsin-Madison.)

*) Added clear_username_at_logout site policy to login cgi to control
   whether the username is cleared on logout.

*) Fixed Apache module to close key file descriptor after reading it.

*) New default HTML login templates. Contributed by Konstantin
   Ryabitsev, McGill University.

*) Modified login cgi and default templates to use utf-8 encoding.

*) Modified Apache module to set Expires, Cache-Control and Pragma
   headers via the Error headers used on redirects.

*) Fixed keyserver.c SSL3_GET_RECORD errors with redundant login_servers
   by closing stdin/stdout/stderr. (Submitted by <mrevil@gmail.com>)

*) Added PubcookieCatenateAppIDs directive to Apache module. Contributed
   by Doug DeJulio, Carnegie Mellon University.

*) Fixed Apache module to halt startup if security initialization fails;
   e.g. when PubcookieSessionCertFile doesn't exist.

*) Modified LDAP verifier so that a few duplicate audit log messages
   are only be logged at the debug level.

*) Fixed null pointer usage in LDAP verifier when version is empty.

*) Improved Unix keyclient error messages concerning keymgt_uri host.

*) Replaced AddHeader() with SetHeader() in ISAPI filter to eliminate
   duplicate HTTP Header values.

*) Modified login cgi to use more consistent audit logging strings.
   Prepended the "first kiss" timestamp to authentication success and
   failure log file messages.

*) Fixed bug in Apache module's AES encryption mode that causes session
   cookies to be unreadable when PubcookieInactiveExpire is on.

*) Modified Apache 2 Makefile to better support Apache 2.2 builds.

*) Modified login cgi to allow 'http:' and 'https:' in app server uri
   query strings without percent encoding the colon.

Changes with 3.3.0a:

*) Applied login server security fixes to address XSS vulnerabilities  
   described in February 2006 security advisory.
   
*) Fixed getcred login flavor by applying correct encryption method and
   setting correct domain on pubcookie_cred cookie.
   
*) Fixed virtual host problems in Apache module by using the correct
   peer name when calling libpbc_mk_priv.

*) Modified several login templates. Added Content-Type definition with
   charset=ISO-8859-1 to error, login, nonpost_redirect, notok, status,
   pinit_response1, and logout_part1 templates. Also removed comment
   with redirect-url substitution from nonpost_redirect template.

*) Modified module and filter extension to use HTTP 302 redirects instead
   of meta-refresh on redirects back to the original resource. Also 
   updated the handling of output values when printing redirect pages.

*) Removed dumpvars.asp from sample web application and installer.

*) Fixed login cgi to report the correct time remaining after a pinit.

*) Applied Bradley Schwoerer's fixes for strict compilers.

*) Applied Steve Losen's fix for libpbc_get_credential_id declaration.

Changes with 3.3.0:

*) No source code changes. A few documentation updates, that's all.
   Note: There is a known problem in the 3.3.0 release with Kerberos
   ticket passing via the getcred flavor. Sites using this functionality
   should continue to use the latest 3.2 release and wait for a 3.3.x
   patch release.

Changes with 3.3.0 Beta 2:

*) Fixed MMC snap-in to display the correct default, inherited, or
   explicitly applied AppId setting.

*) Added lowercase_username and uppercase_username site policies to the
   login cgi for modifying the case of the username.

*) Disabled "If-Modified-Since" headers in Apache module for protected
   pages when setting or updating cookies. This fixes logins for the
   Opera browser. Perhaps others too.

*) Version strings for ISAPI filter are generated from configure.ac, as
   are PubcookieFilter.h and PubCookieFilter.rc.

Changes with 3.3.0 Beta 1:

*) Improved login cgi and Apache module to better handle stray,
   malicious, and other spurious cookies by reading all available cookie
   instead of checking only the first cookie.

*) Removed trailing space after Pubcookie event source name to create
   event log entries that match the source name in the registry.

*) Changed all references to time_t (or int used as a time) to
   pbc_time_t to better support 64-bit and other architectures that may
   represent time as something other than 32-bit integer. Also changed
   all calls to time() to call pbc_time(), which correctly sizes the
   returned time_t to pbc_time_t.

*) Version strings for Unix components are generated from configure.ac.
   pbc_version.h is now generated from pbc_version.h.in, which is filled
   in from the new variables in configure.ac. 

*) Fixed keyserver to propagate alternate config file to keyclient calls
   when keyserver is called with -f option.

*) Added more specific error messages to Apache module for missing
   certificate and key files.

*) More fixes for 64-bit systems from Allan E. Johannesen, Worcester
   Polytechnic Institute, and Steve Losen, University of Virginia.

*) Added AES encryption support to login cgi, Apache module, and filter.
   The application server determines which encryption algorithm is used,
   configurable by the new PubcookieEncryption directive . AES
   is the default and will require a AES-encryption-enabled (version 3.3
   or higher) login server.

*) Removed pre-session cookie processing from the Pubcookie filter,
   completely, and from Apache module when using the POST method.
   Pre-session cookies are a countermeasure to threats posed by
   enterprise-domain cookies; so they're unnecessary when the
   authenticaiton information is transported using the POST method.

*) Fixed login cgi to forgo clearing the granting request cookie during
   POST method login requests; there is no such cookie to clear.

*) Better error handling in login cgi when encountering an error during
   initialization.

*) Removed remnants of Enterprise_Domain setting from MMC extension.

*) Fixed Apache module to recover from pre-session cookie problems.

*) Fixed Pubcookie filter to apply default AppID to root level files.

Changes with 3.2.1a:

*) Defined the maximum allowable amount of post data that the Apache 
   module will attempt to send thru the login process. 10MB is the limit.

*) Added error handling to Apache module and ISAPI filter for query        
   strings that are too long to go thru the login process (>1900 bytes).

*) Restored original Event log source names in the registry for Pubcookie;  
   i.e. we're back to using PubCookie-<x> where <x> is the current web
   instance.

*) Fixed Pubcookie filter to preserve port numbers and query strings thru
   the login process.

*) Increased a number of buffer sizes in Pubcookie filter so that granting
   request data isn't accidentally truncated.

Changes with 3.2.1:

*) Fixed Apache module to avoid possible null pointer in REMOTE_REALM 
   variable. Patch provided by Klas Lindfors, Stockholm University.

*) Revised "fork" verifier to pass username and password via stdin to
   the forked executable. The config file key has been changed from
   fork_exe to verify_exe to avoid accidentally running the wrong
   executable. Code submission from David Houlder, Australian National
   University.

*) Initialize keyclient and keyserver with null credentials to fix 
   potential bizarre behavior. [miner]

Changes with 3.2.1 Beta 2:

*) Fixed LDAP verifier to default to LDAPv3 for all LDAP SDKs and added
   "x-Version" parameter to the LDAP URL. Patch provided by Jon Miner,
   University of Wisconsin-Madison.

*) Added keyclient and keyserver option (-f) to specify alternate config
   file. Patch provided by Jon Miner, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

*) Fixed login cgi segfault due to missing templates. Patch provided by
   Jon Miner, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

*) Fixed 64-bit compilation problems as reported by Allan E. Johannesen,
   Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

*) Modified Apache module to assure that the configured enterprise
   domain starts with a dot.

Changes with 3.2.1 Beta 1:

*) Pubcookie.msi installer will continue with the installation after 
   keyclient errors. User will have to re-run keyclient manually.

*) Added certificate picker to Windows keyclient. This allows a user to
   run the keyclient manually to pick among multiple valid certificates.

*) Fixed PubcookieFilter problem that was crashing the Windows Event
   Viewer on some systems.

*) Added login_host_cookie_domain to make login cookie domain
   configurable. [jeaton]

*) Added realm, if present, to authentication success message in
   flavor_basic logging. [jeaton]

*) Improved error logging in Kerberos verifier. [jeaton]

*) Fixed log message on denied credential request in flavor_getcred.c. 
   [jeaton]

*) Fixed off-by-one malloc error and added malloc failure logging in
   flavor_basic.c. [jeaton]

*) Added PubcookieNoObscureCookies directive to Apache module to replace 
   broken PubcookieNoBlank directive.

*) Pubcookie filter changes: better handling of expired/uncleared 
   granting cookies, favicon.ico exemption, and some memory leaks fixed.

*) Pubcookie.msi installer changes: removed enterprise domain config;
   added third option to RUNKEYCLIENT, download existing key; added
   RUNKEYCLIENT options to GUI-mode installer.

*) Updated OpenSSL libraries to 0.9.7f for Win32. 

*) Fixed memory leaks in Pubcookie library and legacy security code.

*) Fixed logging on FreeBSD to use correct syslog facility.

*) Removed explicit domain scoping of login cookies in login cgi.

*) Fixed bug in Apache module to preserve spaces in post data when using 
   the POST login method.

*) Fixed variable substitution in templating when one tag immediately 
   follows another, e.g. %attr1%%attr2%. Code submission by Steve Losen,
   University of Virginia.

*) Put login cgi redirect logging into normal audit logging stream. 
   (Originally reported by Benjamin Armintor, University of Texas-Austin.)

*) Added kerserver support for subjectAltName wildcards. Code submission 
   by Bradley Schwoerer, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

*) Removed bogus call to free() that was causing segmentation faults in
   the Sun LDAP section of LDAP verifier. (This bug originally discovered
   and reported by Benjamin Armintor, University of Texas-Austin.)

*) Fixed security code (security_legacy.c) to close crypt key files. It
   was leaving them open, which creates stray open files, e.g. one per
   virtual host on Apache. (Patch provided by Frank Fujimoto, who noticed 
   on a host with 18 virtual hosts.)

Changes with 3.2.0:

*) Fixed login cgi's POST login method to provide continue button for 
   browsers that have disabled or don't support Javascript.

*) Exempt the post reply URL in mod_pubcookie so that the entire site can
   be protected using the POST login method.

Changes with 3.2.0 Beta 2:

*) Tidied source code. See doc/HACKING.txt for 'indent' format.

*) Fixed login cgi to use the login_unauth_grant template when an 
   unauthorized application server requests login.

*) Modified login cgi's cgic code to truncate Content-type header at the 
   first semicolon. This fixes some problems with some, but not all,
   Blackberry devices. 

*) Fixed clearing of granting cookie when using POST method.

*) Fixed keyserver "permit" handling to allow args in different orders. 

Changes with 3.2.0 Beta 1:

*) Added Karl Schricker's patch to shadow verifier to make shadow password
   file location configurable.

*) Modified Apache module to exempt the server's /favicon.ico file location
   from authentication. This fixes login problems when some browsers (like
   Safari and Firefox) make parallel requests to a resource and the favicon
   file and don't handle the various cookies very well. 

*) Restrict use of POST login method to same app server host. This
   prevents a spoof of the granting-reply location in a man-in-the-middle
   attack. 

*) Fixed login cgi crash with alwaystrue verifier when userid is null. 

*) Added support for custom per-application login messages to login cgi
   and login template. Introduces optional custom_login_message_dir and 
   custom_login_file_prefix config file variables. 

*) Added keyserver options to allow keyclient to authenticate using
   wildcard certs and to support Subject Alt Names. 

*) Added keyserver option to allow keyclient certificates that are signed
   by untrusted CAs to cache a public key certificate on the keyserver. 
   This allows them to get crypt keys using an otherwise untrusted cert. 
 
*) Added keyclient parameter "-U cert_file" to upload a public key
   certificate to the keyserver. This can only be done from a trusted
   client, i.e. in the "keyserver_client_list" list. 

*) Added another check (using httpd) to configure script for determining
   Apache version. 

*) Added POST login method to ISAPI filter/extension. That is, the filter
   is now also an extension, with the old relay functions incorporated
   into the extension. The filter calls the extension directly by virtual
   filename, which must be set up in IIS; the installer will do this. 
 
*) Fixed credential passing in new POST login method. 

*) Moved more static HTML from source to login templates. New templates:
   notok, notok_badagent, notok_form_multipart, notok_generic,
   notok_need_ssl. Removed templates: notok_part1, notok_part2. 

*) Fixed login cgi crash due during pinit due to fprintf null value.
   Original bug report made by Christian on pubcookie-users list. 

*) Fixed login cgi crash due to missing sub-template file.

*) Added POST login method to the Apache module for messaging between
   application server and login server. This feature allows
   cross-dns-domain logins without the (obsoleted) relay cgi. New server
   directives are PubcookieLoginMethod and PubcookiePostURL. 

*) Modified Apache module to redirect in the 'check-user' hook rather than
   using the current 'type-check' and 'handler' methods. This improves 
   compatibility with other modules that introduce their own handlers. 

*) Modified Apache module to use the request_config record for dynamic 
   info associated with a request. It was using the per_dir_config record. 

*) Apache module now reports authorization failure on unauthenticated
   subrequests. We accept that in subrequests we can't do redirects.

*) Added the variable substitution for the form_expire_time variable to
   the form_expired template. Users who time out will see how long they
   have to authenticate.

*) Fixed filter to not truncate Instance_id to 8 characters. New limit is
   64. 

*) Added version string to login server templates as HTML comment.

Changes with 3.1.1:

*) Fixed redirect back to apps that had sent POST arguments. 

*) Fixed login server crash when the granting key is unreadable. A missing
   or unreadable granting key is now a critical failure.

*) Added form_expire_time variable to make the login form expiry
   configurable. Default is 60 seconds.

*) Added missing APR_CREATE mode in mod_pubcookie for Apache 2 when 
   creating file for delegated Kerberos service tickets. Bug reported by
   Marlow at Sandia National Laboratories. 

*) Added relay_login_uri variable to allow relay to work on same system as
   login server. If it's missing the relay will fall back to the login_uri
   as before. 

*) Added "domain" parameter to the relay uri to allow multiple domain
   relays to coexist on same system. 

*) Modified relay to use its URI as requested rather than relay_uri, 
   which is no longer used.

*) Added workaround to MMC extension for Clipboard format bug found in
   Windows XP Pro.

*) Improved build process on Mac OS X 10.3.4.

*) Fixed MMC extension to handle Pubcookie directives that are also 
   server values, e.g. Login_URI. Default directives are now only
   read, written, and deleted from "/default" instead of both from
   "/default" and "/". This mirrors what the ISAPI filter reads. 

*) Added Pubcookie relay to Pubcookie.msi installer.

*) Updated OpenSSL build to 0.9.7d for Win32.

*) Fixed keyclient to verify the keyserver's certificate.

*) Minor updates to relay documentation.

*) Removed special characters from pathname AppID string to fix bug
   reported by Rand in 3.1.0 release.

Changes with 3.1.0:

*) Added code to detect AIX and module upgrades and set a conditional 
   for make to exclude portions of the Makefile. 
   [miner]

*) Added a warning about running slibclean to the Makefile to display a 
   warning if we're upgrading on an AIX machine.
   [miner]

*) Added krb5_service_name variable to verify_kerberos5.c, so the 
   login cgi can use its own service key and not the host principal
   that other services use.
   [willey]

*) Added more debugging for Kerberos authentication.
   [willey]
  
*) Created "apache2" branch and applied Lars Uffmann's patch to 
   post 3.0.0 code. Applied second patch from Lars.
   [willey]

*) Applied Leif Johansson's no addrs patch for setting up my initial
   (heimdal) Kerberos TGT options: sets a null list of addresses.
   Forwarded credentials typically need to have the address of the app
   server in them as oposed to the addresses of the login server. 
   [willey]

*) Added autoconf test to detect and support Heimdal Kerberos
   [willey]

*) Create a session key pair on the fly if the files don't exist.  
   #ifdefed for WIN32. This change allows a filter installation to
   contain no private keys on disk.
   [ryanc]

*) Added pbc_messages.dll to get rid of the "description for Event ID
   ( foo ) in Source ( foo ) cannot be found" error in the event 
   [ryanc]

*) ISAPI filter now threadsafe. Only one filter loaded for all web
   instances and IP addresses. No global variables.  Context pointer
   is passed between all functions in filter that are in ISAPI control
   flow.  Startup functions have no context and are only called once. 
   Filter no longer keeps global statistics or any other global state. 
   [ryanc]

*) All filter logging now done to event log. Filter will create logging
   sources for PubCookie and PubCookie-<x> where <x> is the current
   web instance. 
   [ryanc]
 
*) Removed PubcookieFilter_Reset feature since there is no longer any
   global state to reset.
   [ryanc]

*) Fixed user field static on expired login cookie
   [steve]

*) Added keyserver "permit" option for authorizing new servers.
   [fox]

*) When changing between flavors username is static.
   [steve]

*) Changed login cgi logging format and content, and added IP, to auth 
   success log message.
   [steve]

*) Added verify_fork.c from Tim Funk <funkman@joedog.org> 
   [steve]

*) Better out-of-the-box autoconf action on RedHat.
   [steve]

*) Updated flavor_basic to allows multiple token substitution in
   sub-templates for login page; to put cursor in correct field on
   login page; to make username from expired login cookie or on reauth
   unchangable (should probably be an option); to accept valid login 
   cookies from other flavors.
   [steve]

*) Added login_unauth_grant template and log entry from login cgi for
   unauthorized hosts that make an authn request.
   [fox]

*) Updated Win32 keyclient to use new threadsafe code. keyclient 
   itself is still single threaded.
   [ryanc]

*) Updated login cgi to delete login cookie on 'really logout'
   [fox]

*) Added ability to write to mirrorfile from ntmpl templates and 
   better (templatable) message for authn server problems.
   [willey]

*) Added static_user_field variable to decide when the user field is
   static or edittable by the user.
   [willey]

*) Updated OpenSSL build to 0.9.7c for Win32.
   [ryanc]

*) Updated PubCookieFilter project to Visual Studio .NET format.
   [ryanc]

*) Added support for virtual hostnames.
   [ryanc]

*) Make config file key lookups case insensitive 
   [willey]

*) Removed some memory leaks 
   [willey]

*) Added use_granting flag to all encrypt/sign calls.  This lets a call
   use a named peer for the DES key and the local session keypair for 
   signing at the same time.  Required for virtual host support.
   [ryanc]

*) Added trim_username_to_atsign variable as a site policy on trimming
   usernames at the first at sign.
   [willey]

*) Added retain_username_on_failed_authn variable to retain the
   username on failed auths. 
   [willey]

*) Removed hardcoded copyright text from click-to-continue POST page
   generated by the Apache module.
   [willey]

*) Fixed virtual server in mod_pubcookie.
   [jeaton]

*) Retired debug variable, use logging_level. Also fixed some logging 
   levels.
   [willey]

*) Added new kiosk mode configuration. 
   [fox]

*) In preparation for multiple server configs, functions now pass the 
   Apache memory pool parameter p, which has been defined for Windows
   as type pubcookie_dir_rec. This allows removal of some Windows 
   specific code, but adds some header complexity. May provide a
   small performance boost as some stack-allocated buffers were
   eliminated in favor of one new buffer in pubcookie_dir_rec. 
   [ryanc]

*) Windows pbc_myconfig functions now work for Unicode or ANSI
   strings. 
   [ryanc]

*) ISAPI filter now supports configuration for each web instance;
   default is still in main pubcookie filter service key.  Arbitrary
   config is possible by inventing a fictitious web instance, this is
   done for the relay cgi for example. 
   [ryanc]

*) Added relay capability for cross-domain authentication.
   [fox]

*) Added login form timeout and corresponding form_expired template.
   [fox]

*) Merged security-context branch for better virtual host support in 
   Apache module. 
   [jeaton]

*) Enhanced PubcookieSessionCauseReAuth to accept a number-of-seconds
   parameter. If the user has entered a password in less time than
   this parameter they don't have to reenter a password. Added 
   necessary changes login cgi too.
   [fox]

*) Apache 2.0 now supported.
   [fox]

*) Changed the behavior of the module install to prepend a '#' to the
   LoadModule line for pubcookie.  This can be removed when the admin
   adds the other pubcookie config lines.
   [fox]
 
*) Build improvements. APACHE1_3 is defined for a version 1.3 build of
   apache.  APACHE2 is defined for an apache 2.0 build.  APACHE is now
   defined in the Makefile for any module build. 
   [fox]

*) Restored read timeouts to version 1.3 modules.  Not needed in 2.0.
   Restored check for SSL. Requires 1.3 or at least 2.0.49.
   [fox]

*) Modified keyclient and keyserver to distribute granting cert. Usage:
   ./keyclient -G <output_filename>
   [fox]

*) Send keyclient errors to stderr instead of syslog so they're seen.
   [jeaton]

*) Changed getcred flavor to support transfer of multiple kerberos tickets
   from the login server to an application server (instead of just one). 
   [jeaton]

*) Added granting cert download option to Win32 keyclient.
   [ryanc]

*) Added new PubCookieOnDemand and PubCookieNoPrompt directives.
   [fox]
 
*) Installed a common command_rec for both apache 1.3 and 2.0 to make
   maintenance easier.
   [fox]

*) Modified keyserver: no keyserver_client_list now means no 
   restriction on access. This was the original setting and seems to
   be the most flexible. 
   [fox]

*) Modified ISAPI filter to prevent looping when granting cookie has 
   expired. Now causes an error message.
   [ryanc]

*) Added FastCGI support to login cgi. This allows one or more
   index.cgi programs to persist as a FastCGI process and handle many
   requests. Configure with: --with-fcgi=<path to fcgi install>.  For
   reference see: http://www.fastcgi.com/
   [fox]
 
*) Remove the global server variable (globalsr) from the Apache2
   module. 
   [fox]
 
*) Fixed pubcookie library logging to work correctly in the module.
   Follows Apache's LogLevel.
   [fox]
 
*) Configure now looks for kerberos dependency in OpenSSL.

*) Fixed occasional core dump during some subrequests, e.g., on
   directory indexes.
   [fox]

*) Added PubCookieNoPrompt capability to the getcred flavor.
   [fox]

*) Fixed redirect to the login server so that Safari won't cache it.
   [jeaton]

*) Fixed missing cgi counters to non-fcgi version.
   [fox]

*) Cleaned up code to prevent compiler warnings.
   [jeaton]

*) Added credential cache cleanup patch from Christopher Maxwell.
   Also (thanks to Leif Johansson) uniqified credential cache
   everywhere.
   [jeaton]

*) Fixed keyclient to run without an existing granting cert and made 
   help text easier to read.
   [fox]
 
*) Apache module needed a local "ap_get_local_host" to work on AIX and
   Apache 2.x. Problem with apache's exported symbols. 
   [fox]
    
*) Moved module build to separate directory, generated by configure,
   to avoid compilation conflicts between shared files.
   [fox]
 
*) Fixed module DSO build to work for Apache 1.3 and 2.x on linux and 
   AIX. Don't have any other systems to try.
   [fox]
 
*) Added static module build for apache 1.3. Static modules not
   supported in apache 2.x. Configure options for module:
   --enable-apache        enables building of module (default on)
   --with-apxs=PATH       builds DSO module (path is to apxs)
   --with-apache-src=DIR  configures static build (DIR/src/modules/pubcookie) 
   [fox]

*) Configure now requires either --with-apxs or --with-apache-src to
   build the module. 
   [fox]
 
*) Provide default DSO module build if apxs is found in the users path.
   [fox]

*) Modified keyserver to lowercase hostnames when creating file names 
   for keys.
   [willey]

*) Add config.h and pbc_path.h to list of files linked to module dir.
   [fox]

*) Fixed keyclient to exit with status 0 on success, status 1 on error.
   [fox]

*) Updated CMU templates in pubcookie/src/login_templates.cmu.
   [jeaton]

*) In IIS MMC, an AuthType defined as a null string will now not 
   show up as a choice in the drop-down for AuthType in the directives
   view.  Any AuthType can thus be removed from the AuthType directive
   list by setting it to a null string in the Server Variables view. 
   [ryanc]

*) Added in missing LIBS so that it links mod_pubcookie to libssl and
   libcrypto, like it should (and used to do); also need the LDFLAGS 
   so we can find the libraries.
   [jeaton]

*) Fixed problem on systems with both Apache 1.3 and 2.0: configure 
   sometimes used the wrong apxs. 
   [fox]

*) Added new Makefiles and relay cgi to distribution. 
   [fox]

*) Added No_Prompt support to ISAPI filter and config.
   [ryanc]

*) Modified Apache build: Don't try to make module if static module 
   build; don't try to install module on static build; lLook for apxs
   in the usual places for default build; don't look for apxs on
   static module build.
   [fox]

*) Updated documentation mainly for P3.1
   [dors]

*) Prevent looping between login server and Apache module when
   granting cookie has expired. 
   [steve]

*) Modified keyserver to break hung connections. The config variable
   keyserver_max_wait_time variable sets the maximum time it will wait
   for data after a connection is established. Default is zero (no
   timeout). 
   [fox]

*) Added possible fix for keyserver running on a cluster of login
   servers.
   [steve]

*) Applied Christopher Maxwell's patch to mod_pubcookie.c to fix
   multiple version strings in Server header. 
   [willey]

*) Replaced (server)->port with ap_get_server_port(), and
   ap_get_local_host() with (server)->server_hostname, to allow the
   port numbers to be correct in virtual hosts in Apache 2.0 and
   eliminate local code for ap_get_local_host in the Apache 2.0
   version. 
   [fox]

*) Added keymgt_peers variable to allow keyservers to push to hosts
   not in their cluster.
   [willey]

*) Added starter.key for keystore initialization.
   [dors]

*) Revised login-install.html guide and config.html reference for 3.1 
   release. Added new templates.html reference and install-filter.html. 
   [dors]

*) Improved ISAPI filter behavior when crypt key does not exist for 
   virtual host: if the page is authtype NONE, it will still serve the
   page. 
   [ryanc]

*) Added message source registry entries for pubcookie, pubcookie-1, 
   pubcookie-2, pubcookie-3 to filter installer.  This is to work
   around problem with IIS 6 in that it sometimes does not have the
   permissions at runtime to modify the registry.
